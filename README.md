## üöÄ Hackathon Project: Smart Startup Name Chooser

### üìç In collaboration with RNE Tunisia & Hill

This project is the code behind a demo built for **RNE Tunisia**, in collaboration with Hill . The goal is to help entrepreneurs choose valid startup names that comply with RNE's naming rules using an intelligent and guided step-by-step process.

We built a **modular pipeline** that takes the user from idea to name validation using simple logic, rule-checking, and semantic filtering. Our aim was to keep the process transparent so that users can understand the decision-making logic at every step.

‚úÖ Stage 1: Symbol and Number Check

Ensures no illegal characters or only digits are used in the company name.

‚úÖ Stage 2: Cursing & Restricted Words Filter

Detects inappropriate, offensive, or misleading words (in French & Arabic) like institutional terms (e.g., "Police", "Banque Centrale").

‚úÖ Stage 3: Legal Type Compliance

Validates the name based on the legal company type:

e.g., SARL, SUARL, Soci√©t√© en nom collectif, foreign branches.

Suggests corrections or additions to match legal structure requirements.

‚úÖ Stage 4: Similar Name Detection

Uses fuzzy matching and semantic analysis to detect if a proposed name is too similar to existing companies (from a provided dataset).

Prevents intentional misspelling or impersonation.

‚úÖ Impact Evaluation

Evaluates whether the name is vague, misleading, or unsuitable based on the company activity.

Suggests better names (GPT-4/Gemini-powered).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### 1. `hill-rules.ipynb`

**Goal**: Encode RNE's name validation rules as functions.

**Contents**:

* Hard-coded rules derived from RNE guidelines.
* Examples of invalid names (e.g., reserved keywords, government-related words, etc.).
* Functions to check rule violations for a given name.
* Output: Binary pass/fail or rule-specific violations.

### 2. `hiillll.ipynb`

**Goal**: Build a user-facing pipeline that guides a user through name selection and validation.

**Contents**:

* Interactive name input.
* Use of the validation rules from `hill-rules.ipynb`.
* User feedback at each stage (e.g., "Name contains restricted word").
* Suggestions for modification or improvements to the name.
* Serves as a minimal working prototype for UI/backend integration.

---

### 3. `semantic-search.ipynb`

**Goal**: Filter or flag names using **semantic similarity** (e.g., for originality or category match).

**Contents**:

* Embedding-based name analysis using a pre-trained sentence transformer or similar model.
* Semantic similarity search against a database of existing company names or restricted terms.
* Helps detect names that are too similar to existing businesses, which could be legally problematic or confusing.
